# Building inspection and rent board services across Alameda County's 14 cities

Alameda County's 14 cities present a diverse landscape of building services and tenant protections, ranging from comprehensive rent control programs in Oakland and Berkeley to state-law-only protections in newer Tri-Valley communities. This comprehensive guide provides essential contact information, online services, and regulatory details for each city's building inspection departments and rental housing programs.

## Cities with established rent control programs have binding regulations

Four cities in Alameda County maintain formal rent control or rent stabilization programs with binding regulations and dedicated administrative boards. **Oakland** operates the most extensive program through its Housing, Residential Rent and Relocation Board, limiting annual increases to **0.8% as of August 2025** and requiring landlord registration by March 3, 2025. The city's building services operate from 250 Frank Ogawa Plaza with online permit tracking at aca-prod.accela.com/OAKLAND, though the portal is currently under maintenance.

**Berkeley** maintains equally strong protections through its elected Rent Stabilization Board at rentboard.berkeleyca.gov, with annual general adjustments based on CPI and comprehensive just-cause eviction requirements. The city charges **$344 annually for fully covered units** and provides extensive online services through permits.cityofberkeley.info for both building permits and rent registry functions.

**Alameda** adopted its rent control ordinance in 2016, covering multi-unit properties built before February 1, 1995. The program website at alamedarentprogram.org provides rent increase limits and just-cause eviction protections. Building permits are processed through the Accela portal at aca.accela.com/ALAMEDA with BuildingEye providing map-based permit displays.

**Hayward** implements a unique system with 5% annual rent caps for pre-1979 units and mandatory mediation leading to binding arbitration. The program covers approximately **9,500 units** and operates from 777 B Street. The city's new e-Permits portal at hayward-ca.gov/epermits offers comprehensive building services with real-time inspection scheduling and ETA notifications.

## Mediation-based rent review programs offer non-binding recommendations

Five cities have adopted rent review programs that provide mediation services but lack binding enforcement power. **Fremont's** Rent Review Board evaluates increases above 5% through non-binding mediation, charging landlords with 5+ units an annual **$16 per unit fee**. The building department uses Citizen Access at fremont.gov/CitizenAccess and offers pre-approved ADU plans with 7-business-day reviews for $1,000.

**San Leandro** combines non-binding rent review for increases above 7% with substantial tenant relocation assistance up to **$7,000** (or $8,000 for special circumstances). ECHO Housing manages the rent review process at 510-581-9380, while building permits flow through the Accela portal at sanleandro.org/permitportal.

**Union City** allows up to 7% annual increases before triggering mandatory mediation through its 2017-adopted ordinances. The city accepts building permit applications via email at building@unioncity.org and offers instant solar permits through SolarAPP+ at solarapp.nrel.gov.

**Albany** operates a non-binding Rent Review Program for increases exceeding 5%, requiring mandatory landlord participation though recommendations remain advisory. The city's building department at 1000 San Pablo Avenue processes permits primarily through email at permits@albanyca.org with 3-business-day advance inspection scheduling requirements.

**Emeryville** takes a different approach with comprehensive just-cause eviction protections and relocation assistance requirements but no rent increase limits beyond state law. Notably, the city lacks online permitting systems, requiring in-person or mail submissions to 1333 Park Avenue with payments only accepted at the Finance Counter.

## Five cities rely exclusively on California state tenant protections

The remaining five cities have no local rent regulations, defaulting to California's AB 1482 which caps annual increases at 5% plus CPI (maximum 10%) for qualifying properties. **Newark** processes building permits through eTRAKiT at nwca-trk.aspgov.com with dedicated inspection request handling at birequests@newarkca.gov. The city offers comprehensive ADU resources including a 1,200 square foot maximum for detached units.

The three Tri-Valley cities share similar approaches to housing regulation. **Dublin** launched its new Citizen Self-Service Portal in July 2024 at dublin.ca.gov/CSS, offering 24/7 inspection scheduling and Tuesday evening residential inspections from 4-7 PM. **Pleasanton** operates Accela Citizen Access at aca.cityofpleasantonca.gov with express same-day permits for qualifying projects. **Livermore** processes over **18,000 inspections annually** through its building division, though inspections must be scheduled directly rather than through the online portal.

**Piedmont**, Alameda County's smallest city, modernized its services with eTRAKiT launching in December 2023 at pied-trk.aspgov.com/etrakit, eliminating paper applications for most permit types. As a primarily residential community, the city requires business licenses for rental properties but maintains no local tenant protection ordinances.

## Regional resources supplement city-specific services effectively

All 14 cities benefit from Alameda County's extensive regional support systems. The County Parcel Viewer at acassessor.org provides comprehensive property information, while the ADU Resource Center at adu.acgov.org assists with accessory dwelling unit development. Cities increasingly participate in the ADU Accelerator Program, offering rebates between **$7,500 and $15,000** for qualified projects.

Building permit technologies vary significantly across the county. Oakland, Berkeley, Fremont, and Hayward operate comprehensive online portals with real-time tracking, while smaller cities like Albany and Emeryville still rely on email or in-person submissions. Most cities have adopted either Accela-based systems or newer platforms like eTRAKiT, with Dublin's CSS representing the newest generation of permit management systems.

Property mapping and GIS tools show similar variation. Oakland and Berkeley provide extensive interactive mapping at oakland-oakgis.opendata.arcgis.com and berkeley.maps.arcgis.com respectively, while cities like Union City and San Leandro offer more basic viewers. The county's Interactive GIS Viewer at gis.acgov.org fills gaps for cities with limited proprietary systems.

## Conclusion

Alameda County's building inspection and rent regulation landscape reflects its diverse community needs, from Oakland's comprehensive tenant protections to Piedmont's streamlined permitting systems. Cities with older housing stock generally maintain stronger rent regulations, while newer communities rely on market forces and state law. The trend toward online permitting continues expanding, though smaller cities lag in digital transformation. Understanding these variations helps property owners, tenants, and developers navigate the complex regulatory environment across the county's 14 distinct jurisdictions. Regional coordination through county services and state programs increasingly bridges gaps between cities, particularly for ADU development and fair housing enforcement.
