# Project Instructions for EstatePal

## Core Development Principles

### 1. Explicit Confirmation Required
- **DO NOT** start writing code without explicit confirmation from the user
- **DO NOT** commit code without explicit permission from the user
- Always discuss and confirm requirements before implementation

### 2. Project Structure
- This is a **monorepo** containing both frontend and backend
- Frontend and backend are separated but exist in the same repository
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend code

### 3. Global Thinking
- Always consider the full-stack implications of any changes
- Think about how frontend changes affect backend and vice versa
- Consider data flow across the entire application
- Maintain consistency in patterns and conventions across both frontend and backend

## Language Requirements
- All code, comments, and documentation should be in **English**
- No Chinese characters in codebase (except for user-facing content if required)
- Variable names, function names, and all identifiers must be in English

## Development Workflow
1. Understand requirements thoroughly before implementation
2. Discuss approach and get approval
3. Implement only after confirmation
4. Test changes locally
5. Request permission before committing

## Code Quality Standards
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Maintain consistent code style
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Avoid over-engineering - implement only what's needed (YAGNI principle)
- Each component/module should have a single responsibility

## Additional Notes
- This is an estate/property related application
- Focus on practical, working solutions rather than theoretical perfection
- Prioritize user experience and system reliability
