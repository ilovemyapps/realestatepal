# [English] 690 Panoramic Way, Berkeley ADU Development Feasibility Comprehensive Report

## Executive Summary

690 Panoramic Way is located in the Panoramic Hill Historic District within Berkeley city limits, zoned **ES-R (Environmentally Safe Residential)**, not R-1H. Despite facing multiple challenges including hillside terrain, Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone (VHFHSZ), and historic preservation requirements, ADU development still offers strong long-term investment value given robust rental market demand and proximity to UC Berkeley.

**Key Data**
- Estimated Total Investment: $280,000-$450,000
- Approval Timeline: 60 days (statutory ministerial approval)
- Actual Completion: 8-12 months (including construction)

**Important Regulatory Corrections:**
- Sprinkler System: ADU only requires sprinklers if main house already has them
- CEQA Exemption: ADUs enjoy complete environmental review exemption
- Road Width: 26-foot restriction may violate state law but hasn't been formally challenged by HCD
- Neighborhood Notice: Already determined by HCD to violate state law

## I. Property Jurisdiction and Zoning Status

### 1.1 Clear Jurisdictional Authority

690 Panoramic Way is confirmed to be within **Berkeley city limits**, subject to the following regulations:
- California Building Code 2022
- Berkeley Municipal Code
- California ADU Laws (Government Code Sections 66314-66332)
- California Environmental Quality Act Exemption (CEQA Section 15268)

### 1.2 Accurate Zoning Identification

**Correct Zoning: ES-R (Environmentally Safe Residential)**
- Berkeley Municipal Code Section 23.202.070 explicitly lists Panoramic Hill as ES-R zone
- ES-R is a unique zoning created specifically for Panoramic Hill
- Described as "one of the most unique and difficult-to-access neighborhoods in hillside fire hazard areas"

**ES-R Zone Special Requirements:**
- Building Height: Standard 14 feet (up to 28 feet with special permit)
- ADU Height: Maximum 16 feet
- Geological and soil reports required
- Enhanced fire protection requirements

### 1.3 Historic District Status Confirmation

Property is located in **Panoramic Hill National Historic District** (designated 2005):
- Exterior design must meet historic compatibility requirements
- However, ADU approval must remain ministerial
- Cannot be converted to discretionary approval due to historic preservation

## II. ADU Regulatory Requirements (Corrected)

### 2.1 Size and Height Limits

**Size Limits (State Law Compliant):**

**Note:** Panoramic Way's narrow width may affect parking exemption eligibility

### 2.4 Sprinkler System Requirements (Important Correction)

**Correct Regulatory Requirements:**
- ADU **only requires sprinklers if main house already has sprinkler system**

- Legal basis: California Government Code Section 65852.2

**Cost Impact:** Significantly reduced, potentially saving $10,000-30,000
