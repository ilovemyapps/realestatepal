# Complete ADU regulations guide for 3340 Gould Way, Sacramento

## Property assessment and ADU development potential

The property at 3340 Gould Way, Sacramento, CA 95827 presents **excellent potential** for ADU development. This existing duplex on a 9,596 square foot lot falls within Sacramento City limits (not unincorporated county) and appears to be zoned RD-10 (Residential 10 units per acre) based on its current duplex use. With no HOA restrictions identified and proximity to light rail transit, the property can accommodate up to **2 ADUs** under current regulations, offering significant development flexibility.

The property was built in 1973 and currently consists of two units (3340 and 3342), each with 2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, and separate two-car garages. The large lot size and existing multi-unit configuration demonstrate neighborhood acceptance of higher density, creating favorable conditions for ADU additions.

## California state ADU laws shape your development rights

California's ADU laws underwent major reorganization in 2024 under SB 477, consolidating regulations into Government Code sections 66310-66342 (effective March 25, 2024). These state laws establish minimum standards that local jurisdictions cannot make more restrictive, ensuring property owners have meaningful ADU development rights.

**SB 9 urban lot splits** allow division of single-family lots into two parcels with up to 4 total units possible, though this primarily applies to single-family zones rather than your multi-family zoned property. **SB 10** gives cities voluntary authority to allow up to 10 units per parcel near transit, though Sacramento hasn't fully implemented this option. More relevant to your property are the core ADU provisions that guarantee ministerial approval within 60 days for compliant projects.

Recent 2024-2025 updates significantly expanded ADU opportunities. **AB 2533** created amnesty provisions for unpermitted ADUs built before 2020, waiving impact fees for low-income homeowners. **SB 1211** now allows up to 8 detached ADUs on multifamily lots and eliminated replacement parking for uncovered spaces. **AB 1332** mandates pre-approved ADU plans from all cities by January 2025, which Sacramento has implemented through their "Shelf Ready Plans" program.

The state permanently eliminated owner-occupancy requirements for ADUs (though JADUs still require it), removed minimum lot size restrictions, and exempted ADUs under 750 square feet from all impact fees. These provisions create a highly favorable regulatory environment for ADU development.

## Sacramento's local ADU ordinance offers two compliance paths

Sacramento City Code Section 17.228.105 (updated through Ordinance 2024-0051) provides property owners two distinct options that cannot be combined: **Option B** follows Sacramento's local development standards, while **Option C** adopts state ADU standards from Government Code Section 66323. Most property owners find Option B provides greater flexibility while still ensuring ministerial approval.

Under Sacramento's local standards, your duplex property can have a maximum of 2 ADUs. For detached ADUs, the maximum size is **1,200 square feet total** (whether one or two units). Attached ADUs can be 50% of the primary dwelling or 850-1,000 square feet (whichever is greater). The city requires 4-foot setbacks from side and rear property lines for detached units, with a minimum 4-foot separation between structures.

Sacramento's fee structure shows significant cost differences based on ADU size. For units under 750 square feet, estimated total fees are approximately **$5,100**, jumping to **$10,200** for 750 square feet and **$14,420** for 1,200 square feet. These fees include building permits, plan review, fire department review, and construction excise tax. The city offers free pre-approved ADU plans through their Shelf Ready Plans program, featuring all-electric designs that meet 2022 building codes.

## Building codes balance flexibility with safety requirements

California Building Code requirements ensure ADUs meet health and safety standards while maximizing development potential. Detached ADUs must maintain minimum heights of **16 feet** (18 feet near transit or on multifamily lots), with an additional 2 feet allowed for roof pitch alignment. Your property's transit proximity qualifies for the 18-foot allowance. Attached ADUs can reach 25 feet or match the primary dwelling height.

Fire safety requirements depend on the primary structure's sprinkler status. Since your 1973 duplex likely lacks sprinklers, detached ADUs up to 1,200 square feet won't require them. ADUs need separate electrical panels and may require service upgrades based on load calculations. Solar panels are required for new detached ADUs over 750 square feet, though panels can be installed on either the ADU or primary dwelling.

Energy efficiency standards follow California's Title 24 requirements, including climate zone-specific insulation, high-performance windows, efficient HVAC systems, and LED lighting. HERS testing verifies energy performance compliance. Accessibility requirements apply to new construction following current California Building Code provisions, with specific standards for entrances, bathrooms, and door widths.

## Planning and permitting follows a streamlined 60-day process

Sacramento provides ministerial review for ADU applications, meaning no discretionary permits, public hearings, or subjective standards apply. The city must approve or deny complete applications within **60 days**, with applications deemed approved if not acted upon within this timeframe. The Permit Streamlining Act requires completeness review within 30 days.

The application process begins with preliminary review through Sacramento's ADU Resource Center. Required documents include site plans showing ADU placement, building plans (or selection of pre-approved designs), and utility connection details. The city's Building Department Help Line (916-264-5011) provides guidance throughout the process. Using pre-approved Shelf Ready Plans can reduce the approval timeline to 30 days under new AB 1332 requirements.

Contact planning@cityofsacramento.org for initial consultation, with offices at 300 Richards Blvd., 3rd Floor. The city's online ADU portal (adu.cityofsacramento.org) provides resources, checklists, and fee calculators. Building permit fee estimates are available for $164 to help with project budgeting.

## Zoning designation determines specific development parameters

Your property at 3340 Gould Way appears to fall within the **RD-10 zoning designation** based on its existing duplex use and lot characteristics. This multi-family residential zone allows duplexes on minimum 6,200 square foot interior lots or 7,200 square foot corner lots. Your 9,596 square foot lot exceeds these minimums, providing ample space for ADU development.

The RD-10 zone typically allows 35-foot height limits, 20% minimum rear setbacks, and specific lot coverage ratios. However, ADUs receive special exemptions from many standard zoning requirements. The property doesn't appear to fall within any special overlay districts, planned development areas, or specific plan zones that would impose additional restrictions.

The surrounding neighborhood shows a mix of single-family homes and duplexes, with several adjacent properties also containing duplexes built around 1973. This established pattern of multi-unit development supports ADU additions without neighborhood character concerns.

## Environmental and special restrictions require careful review

Several environmental factors need verification before ADU construction. **Flood zone status** requires confirmation through Sacramento County's Flood Zone Hotline (916-874-7517) or their GIS FEMA Floodplain Viewer. Recent FEMA map updates affect parts of Sacramento, potentially impacting insurance and construction requirements.

**Fire hazard zones** were updated in 2025 under Cal Fire's Phase 3 mapping. While most urban Sacramento falls outside high-risk zones, properties in designated areas face additional defensible space and construction material requirements. Your property's urban location likely avoids these restrictions, but verification is recommended.

A critical requirement involves **stormwater management**. If your ADU increases impervious surface area by more than 500 square feet, Sacramento requires onsite detention systems. This could include infiltration systems, bioretention areas, or other Best Management Practices. Contact the Department of Utilities early in planning to understand specific requirements.

**Tree preservation** represents another important consideration. Sacramento's ordinance protects all native oak trees regardless of size, trees over 19 inches diameter on lots exceeding 10,000 square feet (which applies to your property), and designated heritage trees. Tree removal permits cost $250-$25,000 depending on violations, with replacement planting or in-lieu fees often required.

Your property's **proximity to light rail** provides significant benefits, including potential parking requirement exemptions for ADUs within half-mile walking distance of transit stations. No railroad proximity restrictions were identified that would limit development. The property doesn't appear in historic districts, though the 1973 construction date keeps it below typical 50-year historic thresholds.

## Four ADU types offer different development strategies

**Detached ADUs** provide maximum flexibility and privacy, allowing up to 1,200 square feet in Sacramento (or 800 square feet under state-mandated provisions). These standalone structures require 4-foot setbacks from property lines and 4-foot separation from existing buildings. Height limits reach 18 feet given your transit proximity, with two-story designs permitted. This option works well for your large lot, preserving existing duplex configuration while adding rental income.

**Attached ADUs** connect directly to existing structures, allowing up to 50% of primary dwelling area or 850-1,000 square feet. These units can reach 25 feet height and must meet architectural compatibility standards. While potentially more cost-effective than detached units due to shared walls and systems, attached ADUs may be complicated by your existing duplex configuration.

**Garage conversions** transform existing garage space without triggering setback requirements or parking replacement obligations. Your property's two separate two-car garages offer conversion potential, though this eliminates covered parking. Conversions benefit from existing structure exemptions and typically cost less than new construction. No size restrictions apply beyond existing garage dimensions.

**Junior ADUs (JADUs)** create small units (maximum 500 square feet) entirely within existing single-family residences. These require owner-occupancy, efficiency kitchens, and may share bathrooms with the main house. While JADUs offer the lowest construction costs, they're less suitable for your duplex property and rental income goals. The owner-occupancy requirement particularly limits flexibility for investment properties.

## Size limitations vary by ADU type and configuration

California state law establishes minimum size allowances that Sacramento cannot restrict. All jurisdictions must permit at least **850 square feet** for one-bedroom ADUs and **1,000 square feet** for multi-bedroom units. Efficiency units can be as small as 150 square feet. Sacramento's local ordinance allows up to 1,200 square feet for detached ADUs, whether building one or two units (combined total).

For your duplex property with existing 1,878 total square feet, attached ADUs could reach 939 square feet (50% of existing) or the state minimums, whichever is greater. This effectively means 1,000 square feet for multi-bedroom attached ADUs. If building two detached ADUs, the combined 1,200 square foot maximum could be split into two 600 square foot units or one larger and one smaller unit.

JADUs remain strictly limited to 500 square feet maximum and must fit entirely within existing residential structures. The state's "66323 Units" provisions guarantee approval for 800 square foot detached ADUs with 4-foot setbacks, regardless of local standards. This provides a fallback option if local requirements prove challenging.

## Recent 2024-2025 legal changes expand opportunities

The ADU landscape transformed significantly in 2024-2025 with multiple legislative updates. **AB 976** permanently eliminated owner-occupancy requirements for standard ADUs, removing the previous 2025 sunset clause. Only JADUs still require owner residence. **AB 1033** now allows ADU condominium conversion and separate sale, creating new exit strategies for property owners.

**SB 477** reorganized the Government Code, moving ADU provisions to sections 66310-66342 for clarity without substantive changes. **AB 2533** established amnesty provisions for unpermitted ADUs built before January 2020, prohibiting denial based on building standard violations unless structures are "substandard." Low-income homeowners receive fee waivers when legalizing these units.

**SB 1211** dramatically expanded multifamily ADU potential, allowing up to 8 detached units on qualifying lots (up from 2). It also eliminated replacement parking requirements for uncovered spaces and clarified "livable space" definitions for conversions. **AB 1332** mandated pre-approved ADU plans from all jurisdictions by January 2025, with 30-day approval timelines for these designs.

Sacramento has actively implemented these changes, updating ordinances through 2024-0051 and 2024-0017, revising fee schedules in July 2025, and launching comprehensive pre-approved plan programs. The city's proactive approach ensures property owners can fully leverage expanded state allowances.

## Financial analysis reveals the 750 square foot threshold's importance

The 750 square foot threshold creates a critical decision point for ADU development. Units under this size pay approximately **$5,100** in city fees, while 750 square foot units jump to **$10,200** - effectively doubling costs for one additional square foot. This dramatic difference stems from impact fee exemptions applying only below 750 square feet.

For a 1,200 square foot ADU (the maximum allowed), total fees reach approximately **$14,420**. These include building permits ($1,762), plan review ($740), fire department fees ($1,160), planning review ($702), construction excise tax ($946), and various impact fees. Using pre-approved plans eliminates design costs but doesn't reduce permit fees.

Utility connections add variable costs depending on existing capacity. Electrical panel upgrades typically cost $3,000-5,000, while separate water or gas meters (if desired) add $5,000-10,000 each. Solar panel requirements for detached ADUs over 750 square feet add $10,000-20,000, though battery storage can reduce system size by 25%.

Construction costs in Sacramento average $200-400 per square foot for new detached ADUs, suggesting $150,000-300,000 for a 750 square foot unit and $240,000-480,000 for 1,200 square feet. Garage conversions typically cost less at $100-200 per square foot. These estimates vary significantly based on finishes, site conditions, and contractor selection.

## Next steps for successful ADU development

Begin with comprehensive site assessment, verifying flood zone status through Sacramento County (916-874-7517), confirming fire hazard zones via Cal Fire maps, and documenting existing trees requiring preservation permits. Calculate planned impervious surface increase to determine stormwater requirements. Contact Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) early to assess electrical capacity and upgrade needs.
