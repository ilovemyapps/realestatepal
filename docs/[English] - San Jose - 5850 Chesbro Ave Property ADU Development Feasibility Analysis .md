# [English] - San Jose - 5850 Chesbro Ave Property ADU Development Feasibility Analysis

# 5850 Chesbro Ave Property ADU Development Feasibility Analysis (Revised Edition)

## Executive Summary

Building an ADU at 5850 Chesbro Ave in San Jose's R-1-8 zone is a viable investment option. Depending on the approach, total investment ranges from **$110,000-$150,000** for garage conversion to **$200,000-$350,000** for new detached ADU construction. The project can generate **$2,000-$3,200 monthly rental income**, increase property value by **$200,000-$350,000**, with annual ROI reaching 7-12%. Important to note that hidden costs may add an additional **$30,000-$50,000** beyond construction expenses.

The 6,000 square foot lot can accommodate up to **1,000 square feet of ADU space** under current zoning, though the 40% rear yard coverage rule may further limit buildable area to approximately 1,680 square feet for all rear yard structures combined. Development timeline ranges from 3-4 months using pre-approved plans to 12-18 months for custom designs, with PG&E electrical connection being the greatest delay risk, requiring 8-9 months for major electrical upgrades.

## I. San Jose R-1-8 Zoning Allows Generous ADU Development with Specific Limitations

### Zoning Advantages and Restrictions

R-1-8 zoning permits ADU construction on any size residential lot with no minimum requirements, a significant advantage for a 6,000 square foot property. The key **40% rear yard coverage rule** limits total rear yard structures to 40% of that area or 800 square feet (whichever is greater). Assuming the main house occupies 1,800 square feet, leaving approximately 4,200 square feet of rear yard, this allows **up to 1,680 square feet of combined coverage** for all rear yard structures.

### Height and Setback Requirements

- **Single-story ADU height limit**: 18 feet
- **Two-story detached ADU height limit**: 24 feet
- **First floor setbacks**: Minimum 3 feet from rear and side property lines
- **Second floor setbacks**: Minimum 4 feet from rear and side property lines
- **Front yard setback**: Detached ADUs must be at least 45 feet from front property line or entirely in rear yard

July 2024 ordinance updates excluded eave overhangs from coverage calculations, providing additional design flexibility.

### ADU Size Limitations

Maximum ADU sizes for lots under 9,000 square feet:
- **Detached units**: 1,000 square feet cap
- **Attached units**: 800 square feet cap (or 50% of main house area)
- **Junior ADU (JADU)**: 500 square feet cap (within existing house)

If property is within half-mile of public transit, no parking required; otherwise standard requirement is one space per bedroom. San Jose also became California's first city to allow ADU condo conversion under AB 1033, creating potential exit strategy through future sales.

## II. South San Jose Construction Costs: More Realistic Price Assessment

### Current Construction Costs (2024-2025)

Based on multiple local contractors and actual project data, South San Jose construction costs are more reasonable:

### Garage Conversion (Most Economical)

These cumulative hidden costs may total **$30,000-$50,000** beyond basic construction costs, making the 750 square foot threshold a critical decision point for cost-conscious developers.

## VII. Strong Rental Market Justifies Investment

### Current Rental Rates (2024-2025)

Current rents in South San Jose 95123 zip code:
- **Studio/1-bedroom ADU (400-600 sq ft)**: $2,000-$2,400/month

- **2-bedroom unit (750-1000 sq ft)**: $2,800-$3,200/month

Area vacancy rates remain below 1%, among the nation's lowest, driven by tech industry employment stability and severe housing supply constraints.

### Property Appreciation

Based on recent market data:
- ADUs typically add property value at **75-100% of construction cost**
- 100x monthly rent rule: $2,500/month rent adds ~$250,000 property value
- Recent San Jose cases show ADUs adding $200,000-$350,000 to property value

Property tax adjustment: Approximately 1.25% annually of total project cost (California property tax rate)

### Actual ROI Analysis

- **Custom design**: 12-18 months (requires full architectural plans and multiple review cycles)

### Key Timeline Factors

### PG&E Electrical Service Upgrade (Greatest Risk)

Recent reports document **8-9 month delays** for main panel upgrades and new meter installation. Starting utility coordination immediately is crucial as these delays occur regardless of permit approval status.

### Permit Review Process

- First cycle: 20 business days
- Additional cycles for corrections: 2-3 weeks
- Typical total plan approval: 4-8 weeks

### Construction Phase

Construction itself takes 4-12 months depending on complexity, with multiple inspection points throughout:
- Foundation inspection
- Framing inspection
- Rough electrical/plumbing/mechanical inspection
- Insulation inspection
- Final inspection

### Special Review Timelines

- Geohazard special review: 2-4 weeks
- ALUC review: 60-90 days
- Tree removal permit: 4-6 weeks (if applicable)

### Success Factors

- Use experienced ADU professionals familiar with San Jose processes
- Submit complete applications to avoid review cycles
- Maintain design flexibility to accommodate unexpected site conditions or regulatory requirements discovered during approval

2. **Control costs**: Consider under 749 sq ft to avoid impact fees
3. **Start PG&E coordination immediately**: Avoid 8-9 month delays
4. **Use experienced contractors**: Ensure knowledge of San Jose ADU regulations
5. **Budget adequately for hidden costs**: Prepare additional $30,000-$50,000

### Market Timing Assessment

Current time is favorable for ADU construction:
- Extremely strong rental demand (vacancy rate <1%)
- Continuing rent growth trend
- AB 1033 allows future sale flexibility
- San Jose city government supports ADU development

### Risk and Opportunity Balance

**Main Risks:**
- Construction costs may exceed budget by 10-20%
- PG&E delays may impact timeline
- Airport review may add restrictions

**Main Opportunities:**
- Stable rental income stream
- Significant property appreciation
- Address family housing needs
- Long-term wealth building tool

### Conclusion

While initial investment is relatively substantial ($110,000-$380,000), San Jose's strong rental market, extremely low vacancy rates, and significant property appreciation potential make ADUs a reasonable long-term investment. Garage conversion offers the best risk-adjusted return, while 749 sq ft detached ADU provides best long-term value. Keys to success include:

1. Choose option matching budget and goals
2. Fully prepare for all costs (including hidden fees)
3. Use experienced professional team
4. Start critical processes early (especially PG&E)
5. Maintain realistic expectations for actual costs and timeline

Based on current market conditions and your property characteristics, recommend starting with garage conversion, then considering future detached ADU addition after gaining experience and cash flow, maximizing property value.
