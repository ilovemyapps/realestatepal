# ADU feasibility unlocked for Chesbro Ave property

Building an ADU at 5850 Chesbro Ave is feasible and financially attractive, with garage conversion offering the highest ROI at 23% annually and a 4.4-year break-even period. The property can legally add one standard ADU plus one Junior ADU despite its 6,000 sq ft lot being below R-1-8 zoning requirements, as it qualifies as legal non-conforming. Two critical site constraints require immediate attention: Reid-Hillview Airport proximity necessitating height review, and existing trees requiring arborist evaluation before design. With construction costs ranging from $80,000 for garage conversion to $357,000 for a premium detached unit, the property could generate $2,000-3,750 monthly rental income while increasing home value by $200,000-500,000.

## Property qualifies for ADU development despite constraints

Your property at 5850 Chesbro Ave presents a solid ADU development opportunity within San Jose's progressive ADU framework. The **6,000 square foot lot** with an existing **1,777 sq ft two-story home** built in 1964 is legally non-conforming to current R-1-8 zoning requirements (which mandate 8,000 sq ft minimum lots), but this doesn't prevent ADU development under California state law. The property includes a **489 sq ft attached garage** that presents an excellent conversion opportunity, and the lot configuration allows for either attached or detached ADU options.

The property's location in the **95123 zip code** places it in South San Jose's Edenvale/Blossom Valley area, where ADU rental demand remains strong from tech workers and young professionals. Current property taxes of just **$2,419 annually** suggest significant Proposition 13 protection, though adding an ADU will trigger reassessment of the new construction portion only. The existing home configuration with 3 bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms provides flexibility for either maintaining full separation or potentially creating a Junior ADU within the existing footprint.

## Reid-Hillview Airport creates the primary regulatory hurdle

The most significant constraint for your ADU project is proximity to **Reid-Hillview Airport**, located approximately 2-3 miles from your property. The Santa Clara County Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) must review any development within the airport influence area, potentially limiting ADU height or requiring special design considerations. You must submit an ALUC referral to determine specific restrictions - contact Carl Hilbrants at **(408) 299-5700** before finalizing any ADU designs. This review typically takes 60 days and may restrict two-story ADU options or require noise mitigation features.

Beyond airport constraints, San Jose's tree protection ordinance poses another critical consideration. Any trees with **56-inch circumference or larger** (measured 2 feet above ground) require permits for removal, with fines up to **$30,000** for heritage tree violations. Before designing your ADU placement, hire a certified arborist to survey existing trees and plan around protected specimens. Contact the City Arborist at **arborist@sanjoseca.gov** or **(408) 794-1901** for guidance. The property shows no HOA restrictions or CC&Rs in public records, eliminating a common ADU development barrier.

## Three ADU configurations maximize different priorities

Given your property's characteristics and constraints, three distinct ADU development strategies emerge, each optimizing different goals:

**Garage Conversion (Highest ROI):** Converting your existing 489 sq ft garage offers the best financial return with construction costs of **$80,000-150,000**, generating **$2,000-2,500** monthly rental income. This option avoids impact fees (under 750 sq ft threshold), minimizes site disruption, preserves yard space, and typically completes in 4-6 months. The **23% cash-on-cash return** and **4.4-year break-even** period make this the most financially efficient choice. You'll need to create replacement parking, but San Jose doesn't require covered spaces for the main dwelling when adding an ADU.

**749 sq ft Detached ADU (Maximum Revenue):** Building just under the 750 sq ft impact fee threshold optimizes rental income at **$2,800-3,200 monthly** while avoiding school and park fees that would add $3,750+ to larger units. Construction costs range **$300,000-375,000** including site work, with a 10-year break-even period but adding **$400,000-500,000** to property value. This option requires careful placement to meet setback requirements: 4 feet from side/rear property lines under state standards, and must be located either 45 feet from the front property line or behind the main house.

**400 sq ft Junior ADU (Lowest Cost):** Creating a JADU within your existing home footprint costs **$106,000-130,000** and generates **$1,800-2,200** monthly rent. This option requires owner occupancy (either main house or JADU), shares utilities with the main house, limits kitchen appliances to "efficiency" type, but allows the addition of a separate standard ADU later. The 6-year break-even period and minimal site impact make this attractive for owner-occupants seeking supplemental income.

## Construction costs vary dramatically by approach

San Jose ADU construction costs in 2024-2025 range from **$300-600 per square foot** for standard builds, with premium finishes reaching **$800-1,250 per square foot**. Your total project investment must account for both hard construction costs and soft costs including permits, design, and utility connections. Building permit fees alone run **$8,000-15,000**, with plan review adding **$1,500-3,000** at $308/hour. Properties requiring tree removal face additional arborist reports and permit fees, while sites in special zones need geological or environmental clearances.

**Prefab ADU options** from companies like Abodu, Bay Modular, and H2 Prefab offer 20-30% cost savings and 2-4 month completion times versus 6-12 months for stick-built construction. These factory-built units provide predictable costs, quality control, and often include permit assistance. Abodu's pre-approved San Jose designs start at **$537 per square foot** for a 500 sq ft unit, including installation and permits. Bay Modular's container-based Solo series offers modern aesthetics with phased payment schedules, while PrefabADU provides DIY kits for additional savings.

Utility connections represent a significant variable cost, ranging **$2,000-7,000** depending on existing capacity and distance to connection points. Your proximity to established neighborhoods suggests standard connections should suffice, but PG&E requires separate metering for ADUs, and San Jose Water Company needs a flow letter confirming adequate pressure (1,000 gpm at 20 psi minimum) before permit approval.

## Rental income projections justify investment across all scenarios

San Jose's robust rental market supports strong ADU income potential, with current rates in your South San Jose area ranging from **$2,000-3,750 monthly** depending on size and amenities. Studio units (300-500 sq ft) command **$1,600-2,600**, one-bedrooms (500-800 sq ft) achieve **$2,400-3,000**, and two-bedrooms (800-1,200 sq ft) reach **$2,800-4,500**. These rates reflect 10-20% discounts versus comparable apartments due to the shared lot nature of ADUs, but demand remains extremely strong from tech workers unable to afford San Jose's **$3,166 average apartment rent**.

Your property's location near major employers and transportation corridors enhances rental appeal. The 95123 zip code's **$1,108,100 median home value** indicates a stable, desirable neighborhood where quality ADU construction will attract reliable tenants. Recent comparable rentals include a 3BR/2BA ADU in East Foothills achieving **$3,750/month**, demonstrating the upper potential for well-designed units. Garage conversions in the area typically rent for **$2,000-3,000**, providing solid returns on the lower investment required.

Property value increases from ADU addition typically range **20-35%** in San Jose, with some premium builds achieving 50% gains. Using the standard multiplier of 100x monthly rent, a $3,000/month ADU adds approximately **$300,000** to home value. This appreciation combines with rental income to create compelling returns: a $357,000 investment in a 750 sq ft detached ADU generating $36,000 annual rent achieves **10.1% cash-on-cash returns** with full break-even in 10 years, while retaining the $500,000 property value increase as permanent equity gain.

## Navigate the permit process with San Jose's ADU support

San Jose's ADU-friendly policies include dedicated support through the **ADU Ally program** (ADU.Ally@sanjoseca.gov, 408-793-5302), which provides free project concept feedback and guidance through the permit process. The city's **Universal Checklist (Bulletin #210)** updated March 2025 streamlines eligibility verification, while pre-approved ADU plans enable same-day permits for qualified projects. You must choose between City Development Standards or State Development Standards - you cannot mix requirements - with state standards often providing more flexibility on setbacks and size limits.

The permit process follows five key steps: eligibility verification using the Universal Checklist, property designation review for special zones, development standard selection, electronic submission through **SJPermits.org**, and multi-phase plan review taking approximately 20 business days for initial comments. Critical documentation includes complete architectural plans, site plans showing ADU placement and utilities, Title 24 energy calculations, water company flow letter, and signed deed restriction agreement if pursuing a JADU. Fire department review examines access routes (maximum 200 feet from street), hydrant proximity (within 600 feet), and address visibility requirements.

Recent 2024-2025 regulatory updates favor ADU development significantly. San Jose became the **first California city** to implement AB 1033 allowing ADU condominium conversions, opening future wealth-building options. The temporary pause on natural gas prohibition enforcement provides flexibility in heating choices, while the city's issuance of **488 ADU permits in 2024** versus just 10 in 2015 demonstrates the streamlined process effectiveness.

## Financial strategies optimize project funding

Multiple financing options exist for your ADU project, though the **CalHFA ADU Grant Program's $40,000** for pre-development costs exhausted its 2024 funding. Future rounds may reopen, with Santa Clara County's **$143,040 low-income threshold** potentially qualifying many homeowners. Private financing through construction loans (7-9% current rates), home equity lines of credit, or cash-out refinancing leverages your existing property equity. Given your home's likely $1.2-1.5 million value against low property taxes suggesting long ownership, substantial equity should be available for project funding.

Consider phased development strategies to manage costs: start with a garage conversion generating immediate rental income, then add a detached ADU once cash flow stabilizes. This approach minimizes debt service while building experience as a landlord. Some builders offer **lease-to-own programs** where they construct and initially own the ADU, sharing rental income while you purchase over time.

## Execute a systematic development approach

**Immediate Actions (Next 30 days):**
Contact the Airport Land Use Commission at **(408) 299-5700** to initiate ALUC review and understand height restrictions. Hire a certified arborist for comprehensive tree survey and protection plan at approximately **$500-1,500**. Schedule a free consultation with San Jose's ADU Ally program to review your specific plans and identify potential challenges. Order a property survey (**$500-1,500**) to confirm exact lot dimensions and setbacks.

**Design Phase (Months 2-3):**
Based on ALUC feedback and tree survey results, select between garage conversion, detached ADU, or JADU options. Evaluate at least three approaches: traditional stick-built with local contractor, prefab options from approved vendors, or architect-designed custom build. If pursuing garage conversion, prioritize this highest-ROI option using existing structure dimensions. For detached units, position for optimal solar orientation while meeting setback requirements and avoiding protected trees.

**Permit Preparation (Months 3-4):**
Compile required documentation including architectural plans, structural calculations, Title 24 energy reports, and site plans. Obtain water flow letter from San Jose Water Company confirming adequate pressure. Submit ALUC referral if required and await 60-day review period. File tree removal permits if necessary with 10-day public notice period.

**Construction Phase (Months 5-10):**
Execute construction with 15-20% contingency budget for unexpected costs. Monitor progress against city inspection requirements at foundation, framing, electrical, plumbing, and final stages. Coordinate utility connections with PG&E and San Jose Water during appropriate construction phases. Begin marketing rental 30-60 days before completion to minimize vacancy.

**Long-term Optimization:**
Price rental 5-10% below market initially to attract quality tenants quickly. Screen tenants thoroughly given the shared property nature of ADU living. Build property management systems or hire professional management at 8-10% of rent. Plan for annual 3-5% rent increases following San Jose rent control exemptions for new construction. Consider future condo conversion under AB 1033 once the program fully develops.
